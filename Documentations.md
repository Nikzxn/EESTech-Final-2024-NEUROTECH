    "type": "image",
    "data": {
        "url": "https:\/\/image-archive.developerhub.io\/image\/upload\/5437\/uvtle1yuxa8mxciuxkjr\/1537112251.jpg",
        "mode": "responsive",

    }
}]$

## Markdown
You can write markdown directly, and we'll transform it right away to what you are used to! ðŸš€

## Linking Pages
To reference other pages in your documentation, use `@` to start linking.

## Blocks
There are many in-page blocks that you can try which will make your documentation richer, just start a new line by pressing enter and 
you will see a plus sign to the left of the line just like this one below. Go have a look! ðŸ‘‡

$plugin[{
    "type": "image",
    "data": {
        "url": "https:\/\/image-archive.developerhub.io\/image\/upload\/5437\/f0b0xtar7gjr9c9yecl8\/1537112320.jpg",
        "mode": "responsive",
        "width": 390,
        "height": 88
    }
}]$

### Code
You can write code by inserting the code block plugin either manually or by using markdown's syntax for fenced code block.

$plugin[{
    "type": "code-block",
    "data": {
        "languageBlocks": [
            {
                "code": "console.log(\"Hello World\");",
                "language": "javascript"
            },
            {
                "code": "print(\"Hello World!\")",
                "language": "python"
            },
            {
                "code": "package main\n\nimport \"fmt\" \n\nfunc main() {\n     fmt.Println(\"hello world\")\n}",
                "language": "go"
            }
        ]
    }
}]$
