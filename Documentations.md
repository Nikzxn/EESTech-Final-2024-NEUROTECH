1. **LLM Prompt Engineering:**
- Context-aware Prompts: Sensor data provides context for generating more relevant and accurate prompts. For instance, knowing the CO2 level or temperature can help in formulating prompts that address current conditions.
  *Example: “The CO2 levels are high in the living room. Could you suggest increasing ventilation?”*
- Dynamic Responses: Incorporate real-time sensor readings into prompts to guide users or systems in making decisions.
  *Example: “The temperature is currently 30°C. Would you like to turn on the air conditioner?”*

2. **Online Model Training:**
- Real-time Data Integration: Use sensor data streams for continuous learning, enabling models to remain updated and accurate.
 *Example: Continuously updating an HVAC system's control model with the latest temperature and humidity data.*
- Feature Engineering: Generate features from raw sensor data to enhance the model’s predictive power and accuracy.
3. *Predictive Analytics and Recommendations:*
- Personalized Recommendations: Use aggregated sensor data to make personalized and timely recommendations.
  *Example: “Based on the current light levels and your schedule, it is optimal to lower the blinds now.”*
- Adaptive Learning: Adjust the learning model in real-time to new data inputs, enhancing efficiency and predictive ability.
  *Example: If the atmospheric pressure sensor indicates a storm is approaching, the model can preemptively adjust HVAC settings to ensure comfort.*
